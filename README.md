✨  About Me

I am a Full Stack Developer with 9+ years of experience in developing enterprise applications and open-source software.
My Opensource Story

All of my projects are released as open-source on GitHub, this includes some of my GitHub trending projects:

    Nothing Private - This proof of concept project showcases the ability of any website to track and identify individuals, even when using private browsing or incognito mode in their web browser. With over 5000K users and 1.8K stars, it has garnered attention and discussions in privacy forums and conferences globally. Its impact has led to improvements from privacy-focused browser vendors to counter fingerprinting, and has increased public awareness of the dangers of browser fingerprinting.
    Blog Post Workflow - A Github action to show your latest blog posts from any sources or StackOverflow activity or Youtube Videos on your GitHub profile/project readme automatically using the RSS feed. It is now used by over 5.6K+ users and running on thousands of GitHub actions runner every hour. It is also one of the top 20 most used GitHub actions internationally in GitHub Marketplace.
    SoCLI Within 24 hours of its release, it garnered over 300 stars and now has nearly 2K users. This tool offers a convenient way of accessing StackOverflow directly from a terminal.
    Motrix WebExtension - A browser extension for the Motrix Download Manager. It now has more than 20K+ users worldwide.

During my free time, I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Due to my significant contributions to DuckDuckGo, I was appointed as a maintainer and community leader with write access to all of DuckDuckGo's repositories. I have also made contributions to a variety of other open-source projects and organizations, including Mozilla, Angular, Svelte, Node.JS etc

I also maintain and contribute to a lot of community open-source projects and libraries. Some of the communities includes Tinkerhub Foundation, Kites Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Patternfly etc. I strongly believe that the true value of open-source is not just the code, it's the community around it.

I create most of my open-source projects to solve the challenges I encounter in life, with many more still waiting to be addressed. I am embarking on a quest to find solutions for each one, one problem at a time.
